<b>Description</b><p><pre>Control an LED using commands "on" or "off" received on the
serial port. This is a simple illustration of how we can
control the system remotely using the serial interface.
Implementation assumes characters are buffered and sent
together as a single command. This is the case with Arduino
and Energia serial monitors. This won't work in Fritzing 
serial monitor since characters are sent as soon as they 
are typed.
